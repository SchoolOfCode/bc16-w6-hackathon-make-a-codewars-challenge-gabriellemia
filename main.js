/*  Welcome to pizza town! 
The only pizza we make around here is - The Hawaiian!
Your challenge is to figure out how many you can make.
Given an array of ingredients, write a function to work out the maximum amount of hawaiian pizzas you can make.
To make ONE Hawaiian pizza you need 1 x "dough", 2 x "pineapple" and 2 x "ham".
The ingredient "flour" can make 2 x "dough".
But there's one more thing... the town dog is notorious for stealing ingredients!
For every whole pizza you can make, the dog eats one part "ham" from your ingredients.
What's the maximum amount of pizzas you can make now?

Examples:
`makeHawaiianPizza(["dough", "pineapple", "ham", "ham", "pineapple", "ham", "dough", "pineapple", "ham", "pineapple"])`
    should return 1 because the dog ate 1 x "ham" for every whole pizza you could make.

`makeHawaiianPizza(["dough", "mushroom", "pineapple", "ham", "ham", "olives"])`
    should return 0 

`makeHawaiianPizza(["pineapple", "ham", "flour", "ham", "ham", "pineapple", "pineapple", "ham", "ham", "pineapple", "ham"])`
    should return 2 
*/

export default function makeHawaiianPizza(ingredients) {
  // Happy pizza making!
}
