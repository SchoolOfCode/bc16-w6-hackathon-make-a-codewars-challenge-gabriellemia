/*  Welcome to pizza town! 
The only pizza we make around here is - The Hawaiian!
Your challenge is to figure out how many you can make.
Given an array of ingredients, write a function to work out how many pizzas you can make.
To make ONE Hawaiian pizza you need 1 x dough, 2 x pineapple and 2 x ham.
But there's one more thing... the town dog is notorious for stealing ingredients!
For every whole pizza you can make, the dog eats one part ham from your ingredients.
How many pizzas can you make from the given ingredients list now?

Examples:
`makeHawaiianPizza(["dough", "pineapple", "ham", "ham", "pineapple", "ham", "dough", "pineapple"])`
    should return 1 

`makeHawaiianPizza(["dough", "mushroom", "pineapple", "ham", "ham", "olives"])`
    should return 0 
*/

export default function makeHawaiianPizza(ingredients) {
  // Happy pizza making!
}
