# Week 6 Hackathon - Build a Codewars Kata

# Planning

ðŸ’¡ Ideation

- Problem should be based around a story to capture user and make it easier to visualise the problem that needs to be solved.
- Look at different algorithms in programming and how each one works, what it does.

  - Sort (merge, bubble, quick, insertion...)
  - Search (linear, binary...)
  - Divide and Conquer
  - Hashing
  - Recursive

- Search may be easiest to facilitate and create tests for. Considering the time constraints and difficulty in many of these algorithms. Go with easier option and can expand if there is time.
- Like the idea around pizza and making one using an array of ingredients perhaps.
- Search for pizza ingredients to make a specific pizza?
- Got to be hawaiian after todays mindset session, also pineapple on pizza is the best!
- Given an array of ingredients, how many hawaiian pizzas can you make? Specify amount of each ingredient needed to make a whole pizza.
- Get the dog involved if there is time! Throw a spanner in the works to make it slightly more difficult but not too much so, a little red herring.

## MVP

MVP 1

- Given input of different ingredients, how many Hawaiian pizzas can you make?
- Start simple with 3 ingredients
- To make one Hawaiian pizza you need 1 x dough, 1 x pineapple and 1 x ham
- Tests must check for certain amount of each ingredient and return how many whole pizzas can be made, eg. 2 x dough, 2 x pineapple, 2 x ham should return 2.

MVP 2

- Given input of different ingredients, how many Hawaiian pizzas can you make?
- Increase amount of ingredients needed to make one pizza.
- To make one Hawaiian pizza you need 1 x dough, 2 x pineapple and 2 x ham
- Tests must check for certain amount of each ingredient and return how many whole pizzas can be made, eg. 3 x dough, 6 x pineapple, 6 x ham should return 2.
- Test for non-Hawaiian pizza ingredients - like mushrooms, pepperoni etc.

MVP 3

- Given input of different ingredients, how many Hawaiian pizzas can you make?
- Increase amount of ingredients needed to make one pizza.
- To make one Hawaiian pizza you need 1 x dough, 2 x pineapple and 2 x ham
- Tests must check for certain amount of each ingredient and return how many whole pizzas can be made, eg. 3 x dough, 6 x pineapple, 6 x ham should return 2.
- Test for non-Hawaiian pizza ingredients - like mushrooms, pepperoni etc.
- This time Hugi the cockapoo eats one part ham for every pizza made.
- Take into account the extra ham needed now to create one pizza.

Edge cases

- Create tests for edge cases, like non-hawaiian ingredients. Also mix non-ingredients with the hawaiian ones in same test.
- Test for if Hugi eats all the ham.
- Test for empty array.

- Create code to make the tests pass.
- Refactor withouty breaking code.

- Do not reveal the solution code in the plan! Ensure you delete before publishing!
